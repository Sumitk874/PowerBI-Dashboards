## Power BI Dashboard Collection

This repository is a central location for my Power BI dashboards. 

Here you'll find interactive visualizations designed for data exploration and analysis. 

**Getting Started**

* Each dashboard is contained in a separate folder within this repository.
* Individual folders may contain additional resources like data source files (depending on the dashboard).
* To open a dashboard, download the corresponding `.pbix` file and open it in Power BI Desktop.

**Note:**

* These dashboards may require specific data sources to function properly. 

**Contributing**

Feel free to fork this repository and contribute your own Power BI dashboards!  Please refer to the contributing guidelines (if available) before submitting a pull request.

This is a basic structure for your README.md. You can customize it further by:

* Adding links to relevant documentation or tutorials for Power BI.
* Including information about the type of data each dashboard visualizes.
* Specifying any dependencies or requirements for running the dashboards.
